{"page_content": "1 2 Fuel requirements Introduction Introduction Fuel requirements Your new vehicle is designed to use only unleaded fuel having a pump octane number ((R+M)/2) of 87 (Research Octane Number 91) or higher. (Do not use methanol blend- ed fuels.) Your new vehicle is designed to obtain maximum performance with UNLEADED FUEL, as well as mini- mize exhaust emissions and spark plug fouling. Never add any fuel system cleaning agents to the fuel tank other than what has been specified. (Consult an authorized Kia dealer for details.) . Tighten the cap until it clicks one time, otherwise the Check Engine light will illuminate. WARNING Refueling . Do not \"top off\" after the nozzle automatically shuts off. Attempts to force more fuel into the tank can cause fuel overflow onto you and the ground causing a risk of fire. \u00b7 Always check that the fuel cap is installed securely to prevent fuel spillage, especially in the event of an accident. Gasoline containing alcohol and methanol Gasohol, a mixture of gasoline and ethanol (also known as grain alco- hol), and gasoline or gasohol con- taining methanol (also known as wood alcohol) are being marketed along with or instead of leaded or unleaded gasoline. Pursuant to Environmental Protec- tion Agency (EPA) regulations, etha- nol may be used in your vehicle. Do not use gasohol containing more than 15% ethanol, and do not use gasoline or gasohol containing any methanol. Ethanol provides less energy than gasoline and it attracts water, and it is thus likely to reduce your fuel efficiency and could lower your MPG results. Methanol may cause drivability problems and damage to the fuel system, engine control system and emission control system. Discontinue using gasohol of any kind if drivability problems occur. Vehicle damage or drivability prob- lems may not be covered by the manufacturer's warranty if they result from the use of: 1. Gasoline or gasohol containing methanol. 2. Leaded fuel or leaded gasohol. 3. Gasohol containing more than 15% ethanol.", "metadata": {"source": "docs/2022MY Telluride OM_1-282.pdf", "page": 10}}
{"page_content": "Fuel requirements Introduction \"E85\" fuel is an alternative fuel comprised of 85% ethanol and 15% gasoline, and is manufactured exclusively for use in Flexible Fuel Vehicles. \"E85\" is not compatible with your vehicle. Use of \"E85\" may result in poor engine performance and damage to your vehicle's engine and fuel system. Kia recommends that customers do not use fuel with an ethanol content exceeding 15%. NOTICE Your New Vehicle Limited Warranty does not cover damage to the fuel system or any performance prob- lems caused by the use of \"E85\" fuel. * NOTICE Never use any fuel containing meth- anol. Discontinue use of any metha- nol containing product which may inhibit proper drivability. Other fuels Using fuels that contain Silicone (Si), MMT (Manganese, Mn), Ferrocene (Fe), and Other metalic additives, may cause vehicle and engine dam- age or cause misfiring, poor acceler- ation, engine stalling, catalyst melting, clogging, abnormal corro- sion, life cycle reduction, etc. Also, the Malfunction Indicator Lamp (MIL) may illuminate. 1 NOTICE Damage to the fuel system or per- formance problem caused by the use of these fuels may not be cov- ered by your New Vehicle Limited Warranty. Gasoline containing MMT Some gasoline contains harmful manganese- based fuel additives Such as MMT (Methylcyclopentadie- nyl Manganese Tricarbonyl). Kia does not recommend the use of gasoline containing MMT. This type of fuel can reduce vehicle perfor- mance and affect your emission control system. The Malfunction Indicator Lamp (MIL) on the cluster may come on. Do not use methanol Fuels containing methanol (wood alcohol) should not be used in your vehicle. This type of fuel can reduce vehicle performance and damage components of the fuel system, engine control system and emission control system.

These gasolines will help the engine run cleaner and enhance performance of the emission control system. For more information on TOP TIER Detergent Gasoline, please go to the website (www.toptiergas.com) For customers who do not use TOP TIER Detergent Gasoline regularly, and have problems starting or the engine does not run smoothly, addi- tives that you can buy separately may be added to the gasoline. If TOP TIER Detergent Gasoline is not available, one bottle of additive should be added to the fuel tank at every 8,000 miles (13,000 km) or every engine oil change is recom- mended. Additives are available from your authorized Kia dealer along with information on how to use them. Do not mix other addi- tives. Operation in foreign countries If you are going to drive your vehicle in another country, be sure to: \u00b7 Observe all regulations regarding registration and insurance. \u00b7 Determine that acceptable fuel is available. Vehicle modifications This vehicle should not be modified. Modification of your vehicle could affect its performance, safety or durability and may even violate gov- ernmental safety and emissions regulations. In addition, damage or performance problems resulting from any modification may not be covered under warranty. \u00b7 If you use unauthorized electronic devices, it may cause the vehicle to operate abnormally, wire dam- age, battery discharge and fire.

Children are given the most safety in the event of an accident when they are restrained by a proper restraint system in the rear seat. If a larger child (over age 13) must be seated in the front seat, the child should be securely restrained by the available lap/shoulder belt and the seat should be placed in the rearmost position. Children age 13 and under should be restrained securely in the rear seat. NEVER place a child age 13 and under in the front seat. NEVER place a rear facing child seat in the front seat of a vehicle. If the shoulder belt portion slightly touches the child's neck or face, try placing the child closer to the center of the vehicle. If the shoulder belt still touches their face or neck they need to be returned to a Child Restraint System. WARNING Small children Do not allow small children to ride in the vehicle without an appropriate Child Restraint System. If the shoul- der belt comes in contact with your child's neck or face your child is too small to ride in the vehicle. In a crash the seat belt will inflict injury to your child's neck, throat and face.

Care of seat belts Seat belt systems should never be disassembled or modified. In addi- tion, care should be taken to assure that seat belts and belt hardware are not damaged by seat hinges, doors or other abuse. A WARNING Pinched seat belt Make sure that the webbing and/or buckle does not get caught or pinched in the rear seat when returning the rear seatback to its upright position. A caught or pinched webbing/buckle may become dam- aged and could fail during a collision or sudden stop. WARNING Seatbelts can become hot in a vehi- cle that has been closed up in sunny weather.

Please refer to your state or federal laws for child seating requirements in the operation of a motor vehicle. Children always in the rear Children under age 13 must always ride in the rear seats and must always be properly restrained to minimize the risk of injury in an accident, sudden stop or sudden maneuver. WARNING Restraint Location Never install a child or infant seat on the front passenger's seat. A child riding in the front passenger seat can be forcefully struck by an inflat- ing airbag and seriously injured. WARNING Hot Child Restraint A Child Restraint System can become very hot if it is left in a closed vehicle on a sunny day. Be sure to check the seat cover, buckles and latches before placing a child in the restraint system. According to accident statistics, children are safer when properly restrained in the rear seats than in the front seat. Even with air bags, children can be seriously injured or killed. Children too large for a child restraint must use the seat belts provided. All 50 states have child restraint laws which require children to travel in approved child restraint devices. The laws governing the age or height/weight restrictions at which seat belts can be used instead of child restraints differs among states, so you should be aware of the specific requirements in your state, and where you are travelling. The CRS must be properly placed and installed in the rear seat. You must use a commercially available CRS that meets the requirements of the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS).

Continue to use a rear-facing child seat for as long as your child will fit within the height and weight limits allowed by the child seat manufac- turer. It's the best way to keep them safe. Once your child has out- grown the rear-facing child restraint, your child is ready for a forward-facing child restraint with a harness. Forward-facing child restraints ODEEV058036NR A forward-facing child seat provides restraint for the child's body with a harness. Keep children in a forward- facing child seat with a harness until they reach the top height or weight limit allowed by your child restraint's manufacturer. Once your child outgrows the for- ward- facing child restraint, your child is ready for a booster seat. Booster seats A booster seat is a restraint designed to improve the fit of the vehicle's seat belt system. A booster seat positions the seat belt so that it fits properly over the lap of your child. Keep your child in a booster seat until they are big enough to sit in the seat without a booster and still have the seat belt fit properly. For a seat belt to fit properly, the lap belt must lie snugly across the upper thighs, not the stomach. The shoul- der belt should lie snug across the shoulder and chest and not across the neck or face. Children under age 13 must always ride in the rear seats and must always be properly restrained to minimize the risk of injury. 3 Installing a CRS After selecting a proper child seat for your child, check to make sure it fits properly in your vehicle.

Side and/or curtain air bags are designed to inflate when an impact is detected by side collision sensors depending on several factors, including the severity of impact resulting from a side impact colli- sion. Also, the side and curtain air bags are designed to inflate when a roll- over is detected by a rollover sensor. Although the front air bags (driver's and front passenger's air bags) are primarily designed to inflate in fron- tal collisions, they may inflate in other types of collisions if the front 3 74 Air bag - advanced Supplemental Restraint System impact sensors detect a sufficient frontal force in another type of impact. Similarly, although side and curtain air bags are designed to inflate in certain side impact collisions, they may inflate in other types of colli- sions where a side force is detected by the sensors. For instance, side air bag and/or curtain air bags may inflate if rollover sensors indicate the possibility of a rollover occurring (even if none actually occurs) or in other situations, including when the vehicle is tilted while being towed. Even if side and/or curtain air bags do not provide impact protection in a rollover, they will deploy to pre- vent ejection of occupants, espe- cially those who are restrained with seat belts.

Steering wheel The steering wheel of this vehicle is equipped with the Electric Power Steering (EPS) system. Electric Power Steering (EPS) sys- tem Electric power steering is a device that uses an electric motor to help the driver provide less effort in steering the vehicle. If the vehicle is off or if the Electric Power Steering (EPS) becomes inoperative, the vehicle may still be steered, but it will require increased steering effort. The EPS is controlled by the power steering control unit which senses the steering wheel torque and vehi- cle speed to command the motor. The steering effort becomes heavier as the vehicle's speed increases and becomes lighter as the vehicle's speed decreases for better control of the steering wheel. Should you notice any change in the effort required to steer during nor- mal vehicle operation, have the power steering checked by an authorized Kia dealer.", "metadata": {"source": "docs/2022MY Telluride OM_1-282.pdf", "page": 162}}

This is a nor- mal characteristic of system operation. \u00b7 To ensure maximum system per- formance, the air conditioning system should be ran for a few minutes each month. \u00b7 When using the air conditioning system, you may notice clear water dripping (or even puddling) on the ground under the passen- ger side of the vehicle. This is a normal characteristic of system operation. \u00b7 Operating the air conditioning system in the recirculated air position provides maximum cool- ing; however, continual operation in this mode may cause the air inside the vehicle to become stale. \u00b7 During cooling operation, you may occasionally notice a misty air flow because of rapid cooling and humid air intake. This is a normal characteristic of system opera- tion. Climate control air filter The climate control air filter installed behind the glove box filters the dust or other pollutants that come into the vehicle from the out- side through the heating and air conditioning system.

{"page_content": "Climate control system Features of your vehicle D: Blower E: Evaporator core F: Heater core If dust or other pollutants accumu- late in the filter over a period of time, the air flow from the air vents may decrease. This leads to mois- ture accumulating on the inside of the windshield even when the out- side (fresh) air position is selected. If this happens, have the climate con- trol air filter replaced by an autho- rized Kia dealer. * NOTICE \u00b7 Replace the filter according to the Maintenance Schedule. If the vehicle is being driven in severe conditions such as dusty or rough roads, more frequent air condi- tioner filter inspections and changes are required. \u00b7 When the air flow rate suddenly decreases, the system should be checked at an authorized Kia dealer. Checking the amount of air condi- tioner refrigerant and compressor lubricant When the amount of refrigerant is low, the performance of the air con- ditioning is reduced. Overfilling also has a negative impact on the air conditioning system. Therefore, if abnormal operation is found, have the system inspected by an authorized Kia dealer. WARNING The oil and refrigerant in your vehi- cle's air conditioning system is under very high pressure. If proper service procedures are not followed an explosion may result. To reduce the risk of serious injury or death, the air conditioning system in your vehicle should only be serviced by trained and certified Kia technicians. 4 CAUTION It is important that the correct type and amount of oil and refrigerant is used, otherwise, damage to the vehicle may occur. To prevent dam- age, the air conditioning system in your vehicle should only be serviced by trained and certified Kia techni- cians. WARNING Vehicles equipped with R-1234yf Because the refrigerant is mildly inflammable and at very high pressure, the air conditioning sys- tem should only be serviced by trained and certified technicians. 4 - 137", "metadata": {"source": "docs/2022MY Telluride OM_1-282.pdf", "page": 241}}

FM radio station 2 AM reception ODEEV068217NR AM broadcasts can be received at greater distances than FM broad- casts. This is because AM radio waves are transmitted at low fre- quencies. These long distance, low frequency radio waves can follow the curvature of the earth rather than traveling straight. In addition, they curve around obstructions resulting in better signal coverage. 4 ODEEV068219NR FM broadcasts are transmitted at high frequencies and do not bend to follow the earth's surface. Because of this, FM broadcasts generally begin to fade within short distances from the station. Also, FM signals are easily affected by buildings, mountains, and obstructions.
