Trailer Stability Assist (TSA) sys- tem The Trailer Stability Assist (TSA) is operated as a vehicle stability con- trol system. The TSA is designed to stabilize the vehicle and trailer when the trailer sways or oscillates. There are various factors that make the vehicle sway or oscillate. Such incidents mostly happen at high speed, but, there is also a risk of swaying when the trailer is affected by crosswinds, buffeting or improper overloading. Factors of swaying such as: \u00b7 High speed \u00b7 Strong crosswinds \u00b7 Improper overloading \u00b7 Sudden controlling of steering wheel \u00b7 Uneven road The TSA continuously analyzes the vehicle and trailer instability. When the TSA detects some sway, the brakes are applied automatically to stabilize the vehicle on the front wheel. However, if it is not enough to stabilize, the brakes are applied on all wheels automatically and engine power is properly reduced. When the vehicle is stable from swaying, the TSA does not operate. Hill-start Assist Control (HAC) A vehicle has the tendency to roll back on a steep hill when it starts to go after stopping. The Hill-start Assist Control (HAC) prevents the vehicle from rolling back by applying the brakes automatically for about 2 seconds. The brakes are released when the accelerator pedal is engaged or after about 2 seconds. The HAC is activated only for about 2 seconds, so when the vehicle is starting off on an incline, always engage the accelerator pedal. 5 WARNING Maintaining Brake Pressure on Incline HAC does not replace the need to apply brakes while stopped on an incline. While stopped, make sure you maintain brake pressure suffi- cient to prevent your vehicle from rolling backward and causing an accident. Don't release the brake pedal until you are ready to acceler- ate forward. 5 41", "metadata": {"source": "docs/2022MY Telluride OM_283-end.pdf", "page": 41}}

Each of these factors affects how many miles (kilometers) you can get from a gallon (liter) of fuel.To oper- ate your vehicle as economically as possible, use the following driving suggestions to help save money in both fuel and repairs: \u00b7 Drive smoothly. Accelerate at a moderate rate. Don't make \"jack- rabbit\" starts or full-throttle shifts and maintain a steady cruising speed. Don't race between stoplights. Try to adjust your speed to the traffic so you don't have to change speeds unnecessarily. Avoid heavy traffic whenever possible. Always main- tain a safe distance from other vehicles so you can avoid unnec- essary braking. This also reduces brake wear. \u00b7 Drive at a moderate speed. The faster you drive, the more fuel your vehicle uses. Driving at a moderate speed, especially on the highway, is one of the most effective ways to reduce fuel con- sumption. .

Keeping a vehicle in good operating condition is important both for economy and safety. Therefore, have an authorized Kia dealer per- form scheduled inspections and maintenance. WARNING Engine off during motion Never turn the engine off to coast down hills or anytime the vehicle is in motion. The power steering and power brakes will not function prop- erly without the engine running. In addition, turning off the ignition while driving could engage the steering wheel lock resulting in loss of vehicle steering. Keep the engine on and downshift to an appropriate gear for engine braking effect. Special driving conditions If driving conditions deteriorate due to poor weather or road conditions, you should pay even more attention than usual to your driving. Hazardous driving conditions When hazardous driving conditions are encountered such as water, snow, ice, mud, sand, or similar haz- ards, follow these suggestions: \u00b7 Drive cautiously and allow extra distance for braking. \u00b7 Avoid sudden braking or steering. \u00b7 When braking with non-ABS brakes pump the brake pedal with a light up-and-down motion until the vehicle is stopped. \u00b7 Do not pump the brake pedal on a vehicle equipped with ABS. \u00b7 If stalled in snow, mud, or sand, use the second gear. Accelerate slowly to avoid spinning the drive wheels. \u00b7 Use sand, rock salt, or other non- slip material under the drive wheels to provide traction when stalled in ice, snow, or mud.

Then, shift back and forth between R (Reverse) and any forward gear. Do not race the vehicle, and spin the wheels as little as possible. If you are still stuck after a few tries, have the vehicle pulled out by a tow vehi- cle to avoid vehicle overheating and possible damage to the reduction gear. WARNING Sudden Vehicle Movement Do not attempt to rock the vehicle if people or objects are nearby. The vehicle may suddenly move forward or backwards as it becomes unstuck. A CAUTION Vehicle rocking Prolonged rocking may cause vehicle overheating, reduction gear dam- age or failure, and tire damage. A CAUTION Spinning tires Do not spin the wheels, especially at speeds more than 35 mph (56 km/ h). Spinning the wheels at high speeds when the vehicle is station- ary could overheat and damage tires, and the rotating wheels may fly away and injure bystanders. The Electronic Stability Control (ESC) should be turned OFF prior to rocking the vehicle. Smooth cornering Avoid braking or gear changing in corners, especially when roads are wet. Ideally, corners should always be taken under gentle acceleration. If you follow these suggestions, tire wear will be held to a minimum. Driving at night Because night driving presents more hazards than driving in the daylight, here are some important tips to remember: \u00b7 Slow down and keep more dis- tance between you and other vehicles, as it may be more diffi- cult to see at night, especially in areas where there may not be any street lights. \u00b7 Adjust your mirrors to reduce the glare from other driver's head- lights. \u00b7 Keep your headlights clean and properly aimed.

Drive belt A loose or damaged drive belt may result in overheating of the engine. Winter driving Severe weather conditions in the winter result in greater wear and other problems. To minimize the problems of winter driving, you should follow these suggestions: Snowy or icy conditions To drive your vehicle in deep snow, it may be necessary to use snow tires or to install tire chains on your tires. If snow tires are needed, it is neces- sary to select tires equivalent in size and type of the original equipment tires. Failure to do so may adversely affect the safety and handling of your vehicle. Furthermore, speeding, rapid acceleration, sudden brake applications, and sharp turns are potentially very hazardous prac- tices. During deceleration, use vehicle braking to the fullest extent. Sud- den brake applications on snowy or icy roads may cause skids to occur. You need to keep sufficient distance between the vehicle in operation in front of your vehicle. Also, apply the brake gently. It should be noted that installing tire chains on the tire will provide a greater driving force, but will not prevent side skids. -- 154", "metadata": {"source": "docs/2022MY Telluride OM_283-end.pdf", "page": 154}}

Since laws vary the requirements for towing trailers, cars, or other types of vehicles or apparatus may differ. Ask an authorized Kia dealer for further details before towing. A WARNING Towing a trailer Always check your towing equip- ment to confirm correct equipment size and installation before use. Using incompatible or incorrectly installed trailer equipment can effect the vehicle operation and endanger you and your passengers. You may require an additional wiring harness connector to install a trailer hitch. Please contact an authorized Kia dealer for more details. A WARNING Weight limits Before towing, make sure the total trailer weight, GCW (Gross Combi- nation Weight), GVW (Gross Vehicle Weight), GAW (Gross Axle Weight) and trailer tongue load are all within the limits. CAUTION Trailer installation Follow instructions in this section when pulling a trailer. Pulling a trailer improperly can damage your vehicle and result in costly repairs not covered by your warranty. Your vehicle can tow a trailer. To identify what the vehicle trailering capacity is for your vehicle, you should read the information in \"Weight of the trailer\" on page 5- 166. Remember that trailering is differ- ent than just driving your vehicle by itself. Trailering means changes in handling, durability, and fuel econ- omy. Successful, safe trailering requires correct equipment, and it has to be used properly. 5 This section contains many time- tested, important trailering tips and safety rules. Many of these are important for your safety and that of your passengers. Please read this section carefully before you pull a trailer.

The trailer also adds considerably to wind resis- tance, increasing the pulling require- ments. Hitches It's important to have the correct hitch equipment. Crosswinds, large trucks going by, and rough roads are a few reasons why you'll need the right hitch. Here are some rules to follow: \u00b7 Will you have to make any holes in the body of your vehicle when you install a trailer hitch? If you do, then be sure to seal the holes later when you remove the hitch. If you don't seal them, deadly car- bon monoxide (CO) from your exhaust can get into your vehicle, as well as dirt and water. \u00b7 The bumpers on your vehicle are not intended for hitches. Do not attach rental hitches or other bumper-type hitches to them. Use only a frame-mounted hitch that does not attach to the bumper. \u00b7 Kia trailer hitch accessory is avail- able at an authorized Kia dealer. Safety chains You should always attach chains between your vehicle and your trailer. Cross the safety chains under the tongue of the trailer so that the tongue will not drop to the road if it becomes separated from the hitch. Instructions about safety chains may be provided by the hitch manu- facturer or by the trailer manufac- turer. Follow the manufacturer's recommendation for attaching safety chains. Always leave just enough slack so you can turn with your trailer. And, never allow safety chains to drag on the ground. Trailer brakes If your trailer is equipped with a braking system, make sure it con- forms to your state's regulations and that it is properly installed and operating correctly. If your trailer weight exceeds the maximum allowed weight without trailer brakes, then the trailer will also require its own brakes as well. Be sure to read and follow the instructions for the trailer brakes so you'll be able to install, adjust and maintain them properly. \u00b7 Don't tap into or modify your vehicle's brake system.

{"page_content": "Driving your vehicle Trailer towing up the brake system. This is not a task for amateurs. Use an experi- enced, competent trailer shop for this work. Driving with a trailer Towing a trailer requires a certain amount of experience. Before set- ting out for the open road, you must get to know your trailer. Acquaint yourself with the feel of handling and braking with the added weight of the trailer. And always keep in mind that the vehicle you are driving is now a good deal longer and not nearly so responsive as your vehicle is by itself. Before you start, check the trailer hitch and platform, safety chains, electrical connector(s), lights, tires and mirror adjustment. If the trailer has electric brakes, start your vehi- cle and trailer moving and then apply the trailer brake controller by hand to be sure the brakes are working. This lets you check your electrical connection at the same time. During your trip, check occasionally to be sure that the load is secure, and that the lights and any trailer brakes are still working. Following distance Stay at least twice as far behind the vehicle ahead as you would when driving your vehicle without a trailer. This can help you avoid situations that require heavy braking and sud- den turns. Passing You'll need more passing distance up ahead when you're towing a trailer. And, because of the increased vehi- cle length, you'll need to go much farther beyond the passed vehicle before you can return to your lane. Due to the added load to the engine when going uphill the vehicle may also take longer to pass than it would on flat ground. 5 Backing up Hold the bottom of the steering wheel with one hand. Then, to move the trailer to the left, just move your hand to the left. To move the trailer to the right, move your hand to the right. Always back up slowly and, if possible, have someone guide you.

Turn signals when towing a trailer When you tow a trailer, your vehicle has to have a different turn signal flasher and extra wiring. The green arrows on your instrument panel will flash whenever you signal a turn or lane change. Properly connected, the trailer lights will also flash to alert other drivers you're about to turn, change lanes, or stop. When towing a trailer, the green arrows on your instrument panel will flash for turns even if the bulbs on the trailer are burned out. Thus, you may think drivers behind you are seeing your signals when, in fact, they are not. It's important to check occasionally to be sure the trailer bulbs are still working. You must also check the lights every time you disconnect and then reconnect the wires. Do not connect a trailer lighting sys- tem directly to your vehicle's light- ing system. Use only an approved trailer wiring harness. An authorized Kia dealer can assist you in installing the wiring harness. CAUTION Always use an approved trailer wir- ing harness. Failure to use an approved trailer wiring harness could result in damage to the vehicle electrical system. Driving on grades Reduce speed and shift to a lower gear before you start down a long or steep downgrade. If you don't shift down, you might have to use your brakes so much that they would get hot and no longer operate efficiently. On a long uphill grade, shift down and reduce your speed to around 45 mph (70 km/h) to reduce the possibility of engine and trans- mission overheating.

Wheels may have sharp edges. Handle them carefully to avoid possible severe injury. Before put- ting the wheel into place, be sure that there is nothing on the hub or wheel (such as mud, tar, gravel, etc.) that prevents the wheel from fitting solidly against the hub. WARNING Installing a wheel \u00b7 When you install a wheel, always remove any corrosion, dirt or for- eign materials present on the mounting surfaces of the wheel or the surface of the wheel hub, brake drum or brake disc that contacts the wheel. Make sure to secure any fasteners that attach the rotor to the hub so they do not interfere with the mounting surfaces of the wheel. Installing wheels without correct metal-to- metal contact at the wheel mounting surfaces can cause the wheel nuts to loosen and the wheel to come off while your vehicle is in motion, resulting in loss of vehicle control, personal injury or death. \u00b7 Make sure the wheel makes good contact with the hub when installed. If the contact of the mounting surface between the wheel and hub is not good, the wheel nuts could come loose and cause the loss of a wheel.

Adjust it to the specified pressure, if necessary. Refer to \"Tires and wheels\" on page 8-5. Wheel nut tightening torque: 79~94 lbf.ft (11~13 kgf.m) If you have a tire gauge, remove the valve cap and check the air pressure. If the pressure is lower than recom- mended, drive slowly to the nearest service station and inflate to the correct pressure. If it is too high, adjust it until it is correct. Always reinstall the valve cap after checking or adjusting the tire pressure. If the cap is not replaced, dust and dirt may get into the tire valve and air may leak from the tire. If you lose a valve cap, buy another and install it as soon as possible. After you have changed the wheels, always secure the flat tire in its place and return the jack and tools to their proper storage locations. CAUTION Reusing lug nuts Make certain during wheel removal that the same nuts that were removed are reinstalled - or, if replaced, that nuts with metric threads and the same chamfer con- figuration are used. Your vehicle has metric threads on the wheel studs and nuts. Installation of a non-met- ric thread nut on a metric stud will not secure the wheel to the hub properly and will damage the stud so that it must be replaced. 6 Note that most lug nuts do not have metric threads. Be sure to use extreme care in checking for thread style before installing aftermarket lug nuts or wheels.

Wheel alignment and tire balance The wheels on your vehicle were aligned and balanced carefully at the factory to give you the longest tire life and best overall performance. In most cases, you will not need to have your wheels aligned again. However, if you notice unusual tire wear or your vehicle pulling one way or the other, the alignment may need to be reset. If you notice your vehicle vibrating when driving on a smooth road, your wheels may need to be rebal- anced. CAUTION Wheel weight Improper wheel weights can dam- age your vehicle's aluminum wheels.

If not, that affects driving performance. Wheel replacement When replacing the metal wheels for any reason, make sure the new wheels are equivalent to the original factory units in diameter, rim width and offset. A wheel with an incorrect size may adversely affect many things: wheel and bearing life, braking and stop- ping abilities, handling characteris- tics, ground clearance, body-to-tire clearance, snow chain clearance, speedometer and odometer calibra- tion, headlight aiming and bumper height. CAUTION Wheels Wheels that do not meet Kia specifi- cations may fit poorly and result in damage to the vehicle or unusual handling and poor vehicle control. Tire traction Tire traction can be reduced if you drive on worn tires, tires that are improperly inflated or on slippery road surfaces. Tires should be replaced when tread wear indicators appear. Slow down whenever there is rain, snow or ice on the road to reduce the possibility of losing control of the vehicle. Tire maintenance In addition to proper inflation, cor- rect wheel alignment helps to decrease tire wear. 7 If you find a tire is worn unevenly, have your dealer check the wheel alignment. When you have new tires installed, make sure they are balanced. This will increase vehicle ride comfort and tire life.

Regardless of the remaining tread, we recom- mend that tires be replaced after approximately six (6) years of nor- mal service. Heat caused by hot cli- mate or frequent high loading conditions can accelerate the aging process. Tread wear The tread wear grade is a compara- tive rating based on the wear rate of the tire when tested under con- trolled conditions on a specified government test course. For exam- ple, a tire graded 150 would wear one-and-a-half times (11/2) as well on the government course as a tire graded 100. The relative performance of tires depends upon the actual conditions of their use. Performance may depart significantly from the norm due to variations in driving habits, service practices and differences in road characteristics and climate. These grades are molded on the side-walls of passenger vehicle tires. The tires available as standard or optional equipment on your vehi- cle may vary with respect to grade. Traction - AA, A, B & C The traction grades, from highest to lowest, are AA, A, B and C. Those grades represent the tire's ability to stop on wet pavement as measured under controlled conditions on spec- ified government test surfaces of asphalt and concrete. A tire marked C may have poor traction perfor- mance.

If you plan to operate your vehicle in snowy or icy conditions, Kia recommends the use of snow tires or all season tires on all four wheels. Snow tires If you equip your vehicle with snow tires, they should be the same size and have the same load capacity as the original tires. Snow tires should be installed on all four wheels; otherwise, poor han- dling may result. Snow tires should carry 4 psi (28 kPa) more air pressure than the pressure recommended for the standard tires on the tire label on the driver's side of the center pillar, or up to the maximum pressure shown on the tire sidewall, which- ever is less. Do not drive faster than 75 mph (120 km/h) when your vehicle is equipped with snow tires. WARNING Do not use summer tires at tem- peratures below 45 \u00baF (7 \u2103) or when driving on snow or ice. At temperatures below 45 \u00baF (7 \u2103), summer tires can lose elasticity, and therefore traction and braking power as well.

If any of your vehicle's lights, acces- sories, or controls do not work, check the appropriate circuit fuse. If a fuse has blown, the element inside the fuse will melt. If the electrical system does not work, first check the driver's side fuse panel. If the replacement fuse blows, this indicates an electrical problem. Avoid using the system involved and immediately consult an authorized Kia dealer. Three kinds of fuses are used: blade type for lower amperage rating, cartridge type, and multi fuse for higher amperage ratings. A WARNING Fuse replacement \u00b7 Never replace a fuse with any- thing but another fuse of the same rating. \u00b7 A higher capacity fuse could cause damage and possibly a fire. \u00b7 Never install a wire or aluminum foil instead of the proper fuse - even as a temporary repair. It may cause extensive wiring dam- age and a possible fire. \u00b7 Do not arbitrarily modify or add- on electric wiring to the vehicle. NOTICE \u00b7 When replacing a fuse, Turn ENGINE START/STOP button to the OFF position and turn off switches of all electrical devices then remove battery (-) terminal. \u00b7 The actual fuse/relay panel label may differ from equipped items. WARNING Electrical Fire Always ensure replacements fuses and relays are securely fastened when installed. Failure to do so can result in a vehicle fire. Do not remove fuses, relays and terminals fastened with bolts or nuts. The fuses, relays and termi- nals may be fastened incompletely, and it may cause a possible fire.

When changing lamps, first turn off the vehicle at a safe place, firmly apply the parking brake and detach the battery's negative (-) terminal. WARNING Working on the lights Prior to working on the light, firmly apply the parking brake, ensure that the vehicle start/stop button is in OFF position and turn off the lights to avoid sudden movement of the vehicle and burning your fingers or receiving an electric shock. Use only bulbs of the specified wattage. A CAUTION Light replacement Be sure to replace the burned-out bulb with one of the same wattage rating. Otherwise, it may cause damage to the fuse or electric wir- ing system. Fully install light bulbs and any parts used to secure them. Failure to do so may result in heat damage, fire, or water entering the headlight unit. This may damage the headlights or cause condensation to build up on the lens. To prevent damage or fire, make sure bulbs are fully seated and locked. CAUTION Headlamp Lens To prevent damage, do not clean the headlamp lens with chemical sol- vents or strong detergents. NOTICE .

Please have the vehicle checked by an authorized Kia dealer immediately. NOTICE We recommend that the headlight aiming be adjusted by an authorized Kia dealer after an accident or after the headlight assembly is rein- stalled. NOTICE You can find moisture inside the lens of lamps after a car wash or driving in the rain. It is a natural event caused by the temperature differ- ence between the inside and the outside of the lamp and does not mean a problem with its functions. The moisture inside the lamp would disappear if you drive the vehicle with the headlamp turned on, how- ever, the level at which the moisture is removed may differ depending on the size/location/condition of the lamp. If the moisture continues to stay inside the lamp, we recom- mend that you have the vehicle checked by an authorized Kia dealer. If you don't have the necessary tools, the correct bulbs and the expertise, consult an authorized Kia dealer. In many cases, it is difficult to replace vehicle light bulbs because other parts of the vehicle must be removed before you can get to the bulb. This is especially true if you have to remove the headlamp assembly to get to the bulb(s). Removing/installing the headlamp assembly can result in damage to the vehicle. If non-genuine parts or substandard bulbs are used, it may lead to blowing a fuse or other wir- ing damages. Do not install extra lamps or LEDs to the vehicle.

This applies not only to the visible surfaces but particularly to the underside of the vehicle. To help prevent corrosion You can help prevent corrosion from beginning by observing the follow- ing: Keep your vehicle clean The best way to prevent corrosion is to keep your vehicle clean and free of corrosive materials. Attention to the underside of the vehicle is par- ticularly important. If you live in a corrosion-prone area - where road salts are used, near the ocean, areas with industrial pol- lution, acid rain, etc .- , you should take extra care to prevent corrosion. In winter, hose off the underside of your vehicle at least once a month and be sure to clean the underside thoroughly when winter is over. When cleaning underneath the vehi- cle, give particular attention to the components under the fenders and other areas that are hidden from view. Do a thorough job; just damp- ening the accumulated mud rather than washing it away will accelerate corrosion rather than prevent it. Water under high pressure and steam are particularly effective in removing accumulated mud and corrosive materials. When cleaning lower door panels, rocker panels and frame members, be sure that drain holes are kept open so that moisture can escape and not be trapped inside to accel- erate corrosion. Keep your garage dry Don't park your vehicle in a damp, poorly ventilated garage. This cre- ates a favorable environment for corrosion.

{"page_content": "Maintenance Emission control system 1. Crankcase emission control sys- tem The Positive Crankcase Ventilation system is employed to prevent air pollution caused by blow-by gases being emitted from the crankcase. This system supplies fresh filtered air to the crankcase through the air intake hose. Inside the crankcase, the fresh air mixes with blow-by gases, which then pass through the Positive Crankcase Ventilation (PCV) valve into the induction system. 2. Evaporative emission control (including Onboard Refueling Vapor Recovery (ORVR)) system The evaporative emission control system is designed to prevent fuel vapors from escaping into the atmosphere. (The ORVR system is designed to allow the vapors from the fuel tank to be loaded into a canister while refueling at the gas station, preventing the escape of fuel vapors into the atmosphere.) Canister Fuel vapors generated inside the fuel tank are absorbed and stored in the onboard canister. When the engine is running, the fuel vapors absorbed in the canister are drawn into the surge tank through the Purge Control Solenoid Valve. Purge Control Solenoid Valve (PCSV) The Purge Control Solenoid Valve (PCSV) is controlled by the Engine Control Module (ECM); when the engine coolant temperature is low during idling, the PCSV closes so that evaporated fuel is not taken into the engine. After the engine warms up during ordinary driving, the PCSV opens to introduce evapo- rated fuel to the engine. 3. Exhaust emission control system The exhaust emission control sys- tem is a highly effective system which controls exhaust emissions while maintaining good vehicle per- formance. Engine exhaust gas precautions (carbon monoxide) \u00b7 Carbon monoxide can be present with other exhaust fumes. There- fore, if you smell exhaust fumes of any kind inside your vehicle, have it inspected and repaired immediately. If you ever suspect exhaust fumes are coming into your vehicle, drive it only with all the windows fully open. Have your vehicle checked and repaired immediately. 7 WARNING Exhaust Engine exhaust gases contain car- bon monoxide (CO).

The use of non-specified fluid (even marked as compatible with genuine) could result in shift quality deterioration and vibrations, eventually, the transmission failure.

Recommended SAE viscosity num- ber A CAUTION Always be sure to clean the area around any filler plug, drain plug, or dipstick before checking or draining any lubricant. This is especially important in dusty or sandy areas and when the vehicle is used on unpaved roads. Cleaning the plug and dipstick areas will prevent dirt and grit from entering the engine and other mechanisms that could be damaged. Engine oil viscosity (thickness) has an effect on fuel economy and cold weather operating (engine start and engine oil flowability). Lower viscos- ity engine oils can provide better fuel economy and cold weather per- formance, however, higher viscosity engine oils are required for satisfac- tory lubrication in hot weather. Using oils of any viscosity other than those recommended could result in engine damage. When choosing an oil, consider the range of temperature your vehicle will be operated in before the next oil change. Proceed to select the rec- ommended oil viscosity from the chart.
