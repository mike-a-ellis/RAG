Ensure that before using the system for the first time, all persons have access to this guide and read its instructions and safety information carefully. Warning Operating certain parts of this system while driving can distract your attention away from the road, and possibly cause an accident or other serious consequences. Do not change system settings or enter data non-verbally (using your hands) while driving. Stop the vehicle in a safe and legal manner before attempting these operations. This is important since setting up or changing some functions as you drive may distract your attention away from the road and removing your hands from the steering wheel may cause you to lose control of the vehicle.

Pull over in a safe and legal manner before attempting to access a function of the system requiring prolonged attention. Even short views of the screen may be hazardous if your attention has been diverted away from your driving. Volume setting Do not raise the volume excessively.

Stop the vehicle in a safe and legal manner before attempting these operations. Let your judgment prevail Any navigation features are provided only as an aid. Make your driving decisions based on your observations of local conditions and existing traffic regulations. Any such feature is not a substitute for your personal judgment. Any route suggestions made by this system should never replace any local traffic regulations or your personal judgment or knowledge of safe driving practices. Route safety Do not follow the route suggestions if doing so would result in an unsafe or illegal maneuver, if you would be placed in an unsafe situation, or if you would be directed into an area that you consider unsafe. The driver is ultimately responsible for the safe operation of the vehicle and must evaluate whether it is safe to follow the suggested directions. Potential map inaccuracy Maps used by this system may be inaccurate because of changes in roads, traffic controls or driving conditions. Always use good judgment and common sense when following the suggested routes. Emergency services Do not rely on any navigation features included in the system to direct you to emergency services. Ask local authorities or an emergency services operator for these locations.
