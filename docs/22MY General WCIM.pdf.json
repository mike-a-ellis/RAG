(\"Kia\") warrants that it will arrange for an Authorized Kia dealer at locations of its choice to provide for the repair of your vehicle if it fails to function properly during normal use. Authorized service facilities will remedy such failures to function properly at Kia's expense, if you present your vehicle to such a service facility during its normal operating hours, provide sufficient information to permit a proper identification and diagnosis of the failure to function, and permit the facility adequate time to perform the necessary repair. As this obligation is subject to the terms, conditions and limitations of this manual, you should refer to the manual to understand which repairs and replacements are covered by this warranty. When an Authorized Kia Dealer makes necessary repairs pursuant to the warranty, it may do so using parts that are new, repaired, remanufactured, reconditioned, or otherwise authorized by Kia. These parts will be covered by the terms and conditions of the Replacement Parts and Accessories Limited Warranty. If an Authorized Kia Dealer declines or fails to carry out a proper repair or replacement covered by this limited warranty without charge to you, Kia will (a) determine if the repair or replacement requested by you is covered by this New Vehicle Limited Warranty and, if so, (b) obtain cooperation from an Authorized Kia Dealer to conduct such repair or replacement without charge to you. However, Kia's obligation to do (a) and (b) requires you to contact the Kia Consumer Assistance Center and provide all materials needed by them to carry out those obligations to you. The Center can be contacted at the address or phone number provided in the Kia Owner Satisfaction and Assistance Section of this manual, or can also be found at the Kia website at http://www.kia. com.

Moreover, whenever this manual refers to a warranty period of months/miles, it means whichever comes first. Any remaining portion of any warranty, except the 120 month/100,000 mile Power Train (Original Owner) warranty, is fully transferable to subsequent owners. 2. Warranty Coverage \u00b7 Basic Warranty Coverage Except as limited or excluded below, all components of your new Kia Vehicle are covered for 60 months/60,000 miles from the Date of First Service, whichever comes first (Basic Limited Warranty Coverage). This Warranty does not cover wear and maintenance items, or those items excluded elsewhere in the Manual. See \"Exceptions\" and \"What is Not Covered.\" \u00b7 Power Train Coverage For Original Owners (defined below), the Power Train Limited Warranty begins upon expiration of the 60 month/60,000 mile Basic Limited Warranty Coverage, and will continue to cover the following components up to 120 months or 100,000 miles from the Date of First Service, whichever comes first.

If the Kia Vehicle was first placed in service as a lease vehicle, and the lessee purchases the vehicle at the end of the lease, the 120 month/100,000 mile Power Train Limited Warranty remains in effect.

Brake linings are designed to wear out as part of the process of stopping your vehicle safely and consistently while providing reasonable levels of noise and vibration during normal use. Brake or clutch linings function properly during normal use even if they need replacement in less than the full warranty period. Rather, most replacements at lower mileage are required by driver usage habits which can cause high rates of wear. In addition, brake lining wear is substantially increased by environmental conditions such as exposure to road salt or due to regular driving in stop and go rush hour traffic. The more wear factors which are present, the more rapid the wear. Resulting repairs and replacements of linings are not covered by your warranty. 7", "metadata": {"source": "docs/22MY General WCIM.pdf", "page": 8}}

The AUTO LINE staff will record the details of your concern by telephone and will ask for the same information as in Step 2. The AUTO LINE program consists of two parts - mediation and arbitration. The BBB AUTO LINE staff will provide suggestions for resolving the problem during mediation. If a satisfactory resolution has not been achieved during mediation, you will have the opportunity to present your case personally before an impartial person or three person panel. This is the arbitration part of AUTO LINE. The arbitrator(s) will make a decision after the arbitration hearing. If you accept the decision, it will be legally binding on you and Kia. However, in some states, if the decision is not accepted, it may be introduced either by you or Kia as evidence in subsequent court action. Disputes handled through the BBB Auto Line process are usually resolved within 40 days of your contacting the BBB. If you have not contacted Kia Motors America, Inc. first regarding your complaint, the arbitration process will take no longer than 47 days. You must use BBB AUTO LINE prior to seeking remedies available to you through a court action pursuant to the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act (the \"ACT\"). In addition, you must use BBB AUTO LINE if you are required to do so prior to seeking remedies available under the \"Lemon Law\" of your state.

In some states, your Kia dealership may provide you with Lemon Law disclosure information in addition to the booklet in accordance with state law.
